The number of Muslim is increasing geometrically and according to statistics, the size of the Muslim population in Canada may cross 15 per cent of the total population by 2030. This also means that the demand for halal food by Muslim will increase as well. Thus, offering halal options in GTA is a pragmatic business decision for anyone in the food industry."

The restaurant will focus on serving halal food option to cater to Muslims around a neighbourhood that lacks this service. Setting up a business can be challenging at a location that is foreign to a business owner. Therefore, the client requires my assistance to find the best borough/neighbourhood in Toronto to open a Halal Restaurant. \n\nThe challenge to find a strategic neighbourhood is to ensure the following criteria are taken into consideration as well:\n\n1.\tWhere the targeted customer is most clustered at.\n\n2.\tLittle to no competition would help to reduce risk and gain a reasonable return on investment.\n\n3.\tThe availability of suppliers such as farmers market, wholesale market to purchase fresh ingredients to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness."
